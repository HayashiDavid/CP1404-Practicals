# Clean Code Lessons Learned 

- **Meaningful Names**: When I used to learn python from the internet, I was told the naming convention does not matter.
So I figured it would be the same but turns out wrong. But since then I'm improving my naming convention by the day.

- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Sometimes I kept repeating my codes even if it's something simple. However, it has 
become less frequent with more practice

- **Consistent Practicing**: With consistent learning and practice, my hands got the flow and used to it. I don't repeat
my codes as often as before and I don't put too complex structure anymore
