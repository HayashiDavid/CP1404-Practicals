# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I think I did a pretty good job on the overall practicals but some of my mistakes are just me goofing off so my accuracy
might be around 80% 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Although I sometimes goof off and made some mistakes here and there. I think  my efforts of practices have made me 
improve. 


### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That I need to focus and not skim the questions 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Some people see the mistakes that you don't normally see

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That I can learn not to do the methods like them and be a tad bit better than them

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[prac_09_PR](https://github.com/AmiePhyo/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation

Whenever I see a good structure, I tend to encourage that behaviour by cheering them up and saying good job and this
person's codes are clean, no redundancy, and follow every naming convention there is. 

### Good Code Review 2

[prac_08_PR](https://github.com/NangLaungPhoung02/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-3059451234)

### Explanation

Same goes for this person. He implemented the OOP very well meaning that he actually understand the lesson
## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would like the teachers to personally teach like a Math subjects instead of seminars and videos

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did my online tests and my naming convention really well
